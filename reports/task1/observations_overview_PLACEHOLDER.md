## What this visualization shows:

This is a 4-panel figure that will be generated when running the Task 1 notebook:

### Panel 1: Observations Over Time by Pillar

- Bar chart showing number of observations each year
- Stacked by pillar (ACCESS, USAGE, ENABLER, TARGET)
- Reveals temporal coverage patterns

### Panel 2: Data Confidence Distribution

- Pie chart showing distribution of confidence levels
- High / Medium / Low confidence percentages
- Quality assessment at a glance

### Panel 3: Observations by Source Type

- Horizontal bar chart of source types
- Survey / Administrative / Operator / Estimate
- Shows data provenance

### Panel 4: Indicator Coverage Heatmap

- Heatmap with indicators on Y-axis, years on X-axis
- Color intensity shows number of observations
- Identifies sparse vs complete coverage

## To Generate:

Run the Task 1 Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/task1_data_exploration_enrichment.ipynb
```

The visualization will be automatically saved to this location.
